## 2021-04-20 - Day 1: Problem framing start

- Task summary: Started this one by sitting down and trying to understand what Iris PCA Analysis should actually become. I did not rush into code yet. The main thing here was to define why dimensionality reduction matters for Iris PCA Analysis so the project had a decent base. I was still mostly figuring out the shape of it, so a lot of the day went into small notes and half clear ideas. A lot of this also meant checking if the numbers were making sense and not just trusting the first result that showed up.
- Deliverable: By the end of the day I had pCA objective written down in a rough way, which was enough to stop guessing and move into the next step. It was not super polished, just stable enough that I felt okay moving forward.
## 2021-04-21 - Day 2: Data collection pass

- Task summary: Used the next day to keep the momentum going for Iris PCA Analysis. I was still piecing things together, so I focused on trying to load the source dataset and inspect feature meanings before transformation and wrote down the stuff that looked important. At this stage nothing was fully locked, so I kept a rough list of things that looked useful and ignored the rest for now. I kept bouncing between the notebook, small observations, and quick plots until the direction felt usable.
- Deliverable: I wrapped up the day with dataset notes mostly in place. It was not perfect, but it was good enough to keep the project moving. I also left myself a few rough reminders for the next day so I would not have to rediscover the same context again.
## 2021-04-21 - Day 2: Data collection pass

- Task summary: Circled back: the output formatting looked messy when printed, so added a cleaner display block.
- Deliverable: Good enough to not be embarrassing.
## 2021-04-22 - Day 3: Cleaning pass

- Task summary: By this point I had the rough direction, so the work became more practical. I spent most of the day trying to standardize types, missing values, and duplicate rows and make the whole thing feel less half baked. By now I had enough structure to keep going without staring at the screen too long, which honestly helped a lot. Most of the progress here came from patient cleanup more than anything flashy.
- Deliverable: I wrapped up the day with cleaned dataset mostly in place. It was not perfect, but it was good enough to keep the project moving. There were still a couple of loose parts, but nothing serious enough to block the next step.
## 2021-04-22 - Day 3: Cleaning pass

- Task summary: Circled back: added a sanity check assertion that would catch obvious data shape issues early.
- Deliverable: Solid now, moving on.
## 2021-04-22 - Day 3: Cleaning pass

- Task summary: Circled back: there was a subtle off-by-one error in the index slicing that was silently skewing results. Caught it and fixed it.
- Deliverable: Solid now, moving on.
## 2021-04-22 - Day 3: Cleaning pass

- Task summary: Noticed something off from this morning — the test I wrote this morning had a hardcoded path, swapped it for a relative one.
- Deliverable: Solid now, moving on.
## 2021-04-22 - Day 3: Cleaning pass

- Task summary: Circled back: went back and reorganized the config section so values are not buried mid-script.
- Deliverable: Cleaner than this morning's version.
## 2021-04-23 - Day 4: Scaling

- Task summary: By this point I had the rough direction, so the work became more practical. I spent most of the day trying to scale the numeric features so PCA is not distorted by magnitude differences and make the whole thing feel less half baked. Once the base made some sense, I could finally move a bit faster and stop second guessing every tiny decision. A lot of this also meant checking if the numbers were making sense and not just trusting the first result that showed up.
- Deliverable: I wrapped up the day with scaled features mostly in place. It was not perfect, but it was good enough to keep the project moving. It was not super polished, just stable enough that I felt okay moving forward.
## 2021-04-23 - Day 4: Scaling

- Task summary: Ended up revisiting this in the evening — fixed the README section that was missing the setup step — embarrassing oversight.
- Deliverable: Minor but worth doing.
## 2021-04-23 - Day 4: Scaling

- Task summary: Quick follow-up: re-ran the plots with better axis labels and a more readable color palette.
- Deliverable: Should've caught it earlier but better now than later.
## 2021-04-26 - Day 5: EDA

- Task summary: This was the middle stretch where the project started feeling real. I kept going and tried to look at distributions and correlations to understand redundancy in the data, then cleaned up whatever looked confusing or weak from the earlier days. The middle part always takes longer than it should, mostly becuase one fix usually reveals two more things to clean up. I kept bouncing between the notebook, small observations, and quick plots until the direction felt usable.
- Deliverable: I wrapped up the day with eDA summary mostly in place. It was not perfect, but it was good enough to keep the project moving. I also left myself a few rough reminders for the next day so I would not have to rediscover the same context again.
